We are an research group working on nonlinear dynamics. There are two researh lines that we follow 

Synchronization in coupled Hamiltonian systems
======
In particular, we work on synchronization for three different categories of coupled
Hamiltonian systems: i) MS in coupled classical Hamiltonian systems;
ii) MS in coupled quantum Hamiltonian systems; iii) Hybrid synchro-
nization in mixed quantum-classical systems.

Coherent dynamics and nonlinear waves in bosonic Josephson junctions
======
In particular, we work on
